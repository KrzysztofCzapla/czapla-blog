        <h1>First Blog Post</h1>
<p>This is kind of a test post, so don't overanalyze this please lol</p>
<h2>My first experience with minimal blogs</h2>
<p>While scrolling <a href="https://hckrnews.com/">hackernews</a> I often stumble upon very interesting blogs and articles that 
are always written on those very minimalistic sites with almost no images. </p>
<p>At first they seemed very "old" and archaic,
but comparing them to the usual slop on the web, where you need to click 5 different pop-ups before actually
reading anything, they didn't seem that bad.</p>
<p>Over the years I also found some people who had their own personal blogs from other sites that I really liked. 
I will link them below. They included mostly people related to tech, which is the reason why this very minimalistic
seemed unusual. I really got to like this idea of minimalistic personal page, especially because I try to live minimalistically
in real life as well.</p>
<h2>My Blog</h2>
<p>Because of that and because of other reasons that I will talk about in another post I decided to also try this kind of thing.</p>
<p>I think that I will also do some other here stuff except blogging. I also want to treat this kind of like a "diary" that
I can look at after some years and realise how cringy I was.</p>
<p>Main topics that I plan to write on are tech, personal projects of mine, philosophy and general thoughts.
Nothing extraordinary, I am still not sure about all this, but I wanted to try this so here we are.</p>
<h2>Blogging Engine</h2>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/grski/braindead">braindead</a> by Olaf GĂłrski I decided to write my own blogging engine
that can fit my needs. It didn't take a lot of time but it was a fun experience.</p>
<p>Basic idea is to write posts in markdown and using jinja2 templates transform them automatically into html that can 
be easily released using, for example, Github Pages.</p>
<p>And that way <a href="https://github.com/KrzysztofCzapla/heron-blog-engine">heron-blog-engine</a> was born.
I honestly doubt anyone will ever use it.
I really created it with only my page in mind, but it can be used by others of course. There are a lot of stuff
that I want to change there but its okay for now.</p>
<h2>Next posts</h2>
<p>This post is just boringly describing the blog - how it works and why it is the way it is.
It's more of a test post really, nothing really interesting here, but hey we have to start somewhere right.</p>
<p>In the next post I want to say more about me and about stuff I want to start doing and the reason why.</p>
<h2>Inspirations for this site</h2>
<p>I need to also describe my main inspirations for this site:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://grski.pl/">grski.pl</a> - Olaf GĂłrski - I owe a lot to the guy behind this blog. It inspired me to pursue my career. 
I wouldn't be where I am today without him. I also like his style of blogging a lot.</li>
<li><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/">lukesmith.xyz</a> - Luke Smith is a rather controversial figure, but I really like the
style of his page. I think I want my page to be more like his - have more different sections and have this old-internet vibe.
Also I love his posts on philosophy, although I fundamentally disagree with him on most of his takes lol.</li>
<li><a href="https://levels.io/blog/">levels.io/blog</a> - Peter Levels - very popular guy who makes a lot of money from his personal projects.
I want to try something similar, on smaller scale of course and while being conscious of the survival-ship bias, 
but more on that in another post. Anyway his blog posts about his travels in Asia are amazing. I like how his posts
can kind of show the story of his life.</li>
</ol>
