# First Blog Post

This is kind of a test post, so don't overanalyze this please lol

## My first experience with minimal blogs

While scrolling [hackernews](https://hckrnews.com/) I often stumble upon very interesting blogs and articles that 
are always written on those very minimalistic sites with almost no images. 

At first they seemed very "old" and archaic,
but comparing them to the usual slop on the web, where you need to click 5 different pop-ups before actually
reading anything, they didn't seem that bad.

Over the years I also found some people who had their own personal blogs from other sites that I really liked. 
I will link them below. They included mostly people related to tech, which is the reason why this very minimalistic
seemed unusual. I really got to like this idea of minimalistic personal page, especially because I try to live minimalistically
in real life as well.

## My Blog

Because of that and because of other reasons that I will talk about in another post I decided to also try this kind of thing.

I think that I will also do some other here stuff except blogging. I also want to treat this kind of like a "diary" that
I can look at after some years and realise how cringy I was.

Main topics that I plan to write on are tech, personal projects of mine, philosophy and general thoughts.
Nothing extraordinary, I am still not sure about all this, but I wanted to try this so here we are.

## Blogging Engine

Inspired by [braindead](https://github.com/grski/braindead) by Olaf Górski I decided to write my own blogging engine
that can fit my needs. It didn't take a lot of time but it was a fun experience.

Basic idea is to write posts in markdown and using jinja2 templates transform them automatically into html that can 
be easily released using, for example, Github Pages.

And that way [heron-blog-engine](https://github.com/KrzysztofCzapla/heron-blog-engine) was born.
I honestly doubt anyone will ever use it.
I really created it with only my page in mind, but it can be used by others of course. There are a lot of stuff
that I want to change there but its okay for now.

## Next posts

This post is just boringly describing the blog - how it works and why it is the way it is.
It's more of a test post really, nothing really interesting here, but hey we have to start somewhere right.

In the next post I want to say more about me and about stuff I want to start doing and the reason why.

## Inspirations for this site

I need to also describe my main inspirations for this site:

1. [grski.pl](https://grski.pl/) - Olaf Górski - I owe a lot to the guy behind this blog. It inspired me to pursue my career. 
I wouldn't be where I am today without him. I also like his style of blogging a lot.
2. [lukesmith.xyz](https://lukesmith.xyz/) - Luke Smith is a rather controversial figure, but I really like the
style of his page. I think I want my page to be more like his - have more different sections and have this old-internet vibe.
Also I love his posts on philosophy, although I fundamentally disagree with him on most of his takes lol.
3. [levels.io/blog](https://levels.io/blog/) - Peter Levels - very popular guy who makes a lot of money from his personal projects.
I want to try something similar, on smaller scale of course and while being conscious of the survival-ship bias, 
but more on that in another post. Anyway his blog posts about his travels in Asia are amazing. I like how his posts
can kind of show the story of his life.
